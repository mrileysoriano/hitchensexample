Hello CDSsi Digital Publishing Cohort!

You have just discovered another GitHub Website that I've put together. While the Hitchens theme isn't my favorite (it's so yellow!), it is nevertheless a great theme for displaying book-like content without using Bookdown (which you'll learn more about on Wednesday!). 

More than anything, I wanted to show you that it is possible to build out a fully functioning, Markdown-based website it no more than 15 minutes. You're site might not look great with just 15 minutes of work but it gets the job done!

If you're interested in learning more about this theme or any other, please feel free to contact [me](mailto:mrs319@miami.edu) or to simply chat with me throughout the course of the week!
